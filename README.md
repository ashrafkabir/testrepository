## Installation

This is a Starter Kit (SK), which is designed to get you up and running quickly with a common pattern, and to provide information and best practices around Watson services and bots. This application demonstrates how the Conversation service can be used with different bot kits such as those from Facebook to enable users to have an intuitive and natural conversation with the bots.
